## Problem Statement

Priya wants to reach the top of a building of height X with the help of a ladder. She can take any three of the possible steps given. Find which three steps Priya should take such that she could reach closest to height X. Return the sum of three steps. The steps can be positive as well as negative. Positive steps means climbing up the ladder and negative steps mean climbing down the ladder.

## Examples

Given possible steps Priya can take = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and X = 1.
The sum that is closest to the X is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
