# Day - 5

## Problem Statement

In a prison, the prisoners stand in a queue facing in one direction. Each prisoner is able to see the head of the prisoner in front of him in the queue,but cannot see the head of prisoners standing behind him.

Now the jailer is going to ask each prisoner, starting from the first prisoner, the number of prisoners having a height slightly smaller than his height. If he answers correctly he is saved, otherwise executed. The prisoners are smart and are allowed to discuss a strategy before the jailer starts questioning them.

To the jailors surprise,all the prisoners answered correctly and were saved from being executed.

Return an array of integers consisting of answers given by each prisoner to the jailor.



## Examples

Example:
Input: [5,2,6,1] --> height array
Output: [2,1,1,0]



## Pre-reqs

vector <int> countSmaller( vector <int> & nums) { }
